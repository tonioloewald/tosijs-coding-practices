// six real runs of this exact gate showed the money was being spent in the wrong place:
//   - refute rate is LOWEST on blockers (3%) and HIGHEST on minor/nit (11%);
//   - but a finding's truth only matters when it changes the release decision. A blocker's
//     truth gates the tag — a false blocker wastes a whole fix cycle, so verifying it is
//     cheap insurance on a rare, expensive error. A minor/nit is a follow-up either way, so
//     verifying it changes nothing and is pure waste.
// So we NEVER adversarially verify minor/nit — they ship reported-but-unverified — and we
// scale how much of the rest we verify:
//   full (default, pre-tag): verify blocker + major.   ~35% cheaper than verify-everything.
//   fast (iterating):        verify blocker only.       ~62% cheaper — run it every iteration.

Test per line: does it change what a reader would DO? If not it's spam (keep receipts for destructive/rare actions). Raise it even though it reads cosmetic — spam is almost always a SYMPTOM (a debug log left from a bug hunt, a deprecation nobody fixed, retry noise from a flaky dep), so flagging it drives the underlying cause to be fixed; and noise trains the team to stop reading output, so the one real line scrolls past unseen.

    key: 'ecosystem',
    title: 'Ecosystem & abstraction health (BOTH directions)',
    checks: `This lens runs in TWO DIRECTIONS AND BOTH HALVES ARE MANDATORY. Reviewers reliably do 7a and skip 7b — DO NOT. Run both and report both, as separate sections of your findings.

=== 7a. OUTGOING — are we paying for someone else's missing seam? ===
Look UP and OUT, not down. Lens 6 asks "is the DX we PROVIDE good?" — you ask "is the DX we CONSUME good, and is this code quietly paying for it being bad?" Hunt for:
- **Work happening in the wrong layer:** boilerplate or workarounds that exist here only because an upstream tool (tosijs, tosijs-ui, tjs-lang, tosijs-schema, the site builder, haltija) lacks a seam. If several consumers each hand-roll the same thing, that is ONE missing library affordance, not N local problems.
- **Nascent anti-patterns:** a clever workaround one copy-paste away from becoming convention; a pattern spreading because the right way is too hard; code fighting the observant model (reaching for a re-render because a binding was awkward to express).
- **Compensating complexity:** defensive unwrapping, sanitizing inputs the upstream should have handled, indirection routing around a limitation, a version pin that dodges a bug instead of fixing it.
- **Normalized friction:** loop steps we've stopped noticing (manual regeneration, port collisions, cert setup, two lockfiles, a script renamed to dodge a builtin). Familiarity is not the same as fine.
For each outgoing finding, name the UPSTREAM tool and the missing seam/affordance, and propose the upstream fix. The recommendation must be to **FILE A GITHUB ISSUE on the upstream repo** (the channel) and mirror it in this repo's UPSTREAM.md with the issue URL — NEVER to go edit the upstream repo directly (agents stay in their own repo; that requires human signoff). Do not accept a silent workaround.

=== 7b. INCOMING — what have our consumers filed against US? ===
ENUMERATE, DO NOT GLANCE. This is not a footnote; it is half the lens. Resolve the repo from \`git remote get-url origin\`, then run:
  gh issue list -R tonioloewald/<this-repo> --state open
- GIVE EVERY OPEN ISSUE A DISPOSITION. For each, state which: FIXED BY THIS RELEASE (-> close it naming the version, AND put it in the release notes), STILL OPEN (-> say so), or STALE (-> close it). An issue this release silently closes can REFRAME WHAT THE RELEASE IS — e.g. a library migration that also happens to unblock a downstream port is not just a library migration, and the notes must say so.
- CROSS-CHECK EVERY WORKAROUND FROM 7a AGAINST THE ISSUE LIST. Is there already an issue for it? A TEST LOOSENED, OR COMPLEXITY ADDED, TO ROUTE AROUND A BUG WE FILED AGAINST OURSELVES is the signature failure of this half — 7a flags the SHAPE of it and will not connect it to the open issue unless you deliberately do.
- ON A BREAKING OR TIGHTENING CHANGE, MEASURE THE CONSUMER FOOTPRINT — do not assume it: \`curl -s https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/last-month/<pkg>\` + the repo's GitHub dependents. The numbers calibrate severity BOTH ways: a footprint that quietly grew makes a casual break a real finding, and a measured-zero consumer base makes a breakage/publish-state finding bookkeeping (minor), NOT a blocker. Grade against the base you measured, not the one you imagined. (Known-real as of writing: tosijs, tosijs-ui — dozens of users by download stats. The ecosystem has never received a breakage complaint.)
Report 7b findings even when they are not defects in the diff (e.g. "issue #N has been fixed since 1.6.11 and is still open — close it").`,

- Did this release **contradict, outdate, or vindicate** a documented practice? A practice that didn't match reality is a BUG IN THE KNOWLEDGE BASE — say so and propose the correction (with attribution), don't route around it.
- What did we learn here that **would have saved time if it had been written down**? Propose the entry and which doc it belongs in.
- Did the **process** hold — did a lens miss something that bit us, is a lens dead weight, did the gate work?
- If the repo carries a PRIOR lens-8 write-back claim (a checked TODO item, a docs/reviews report), verify it NAMES THE COMMIT RANGE it covered (\`<base>..<sha>\`) and that nothing landed after it. A claim with no range, or one that predates later commits while asserting completion, is a finding — staleness must be checkable, not merely noticeable.
- Are this project's own CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md still accurate after the change?
- RUN THE READ DIRECTION TOO: did the practices move under THIS project? \`git -C <practices-checkout> log --oneline --since=<this project's last release date>\` and disposition each change that touches how this project works — adopted, already compliant, or deliberately diverging (the divergence goes to 00-stack.md "Known divergences"). A practices change nobody dispositioned is a silent fork.

Security holes are LATENT: they sit in already-shipped code outside the diff, so escalate any touched security subsystem to WHOLE-SUBSYSTEM depth regardless of diff size (a minor bump's review once found five VM blockers, four latent in the prior shipped release). Check: unauthenticated reachable surfaces (who can hit this endpoint/port/handler, from where, with what Origin); input validation at every trust boundary; fail-open vs fail-closed on every gate (a gate must never report a pass it didn't earn, and a documented divergence at a gate is still fail-open); what a compromised or malicious caller could make this code do; whether tests cover the hostile input class, not just the happy path. Findings whose subject is an isolation, capability, or auth guarantee get adversarially verified regardless of reported severity.`,
  },
  {
    key: 'blast-radius',
    title: 'Blast radius (what propagates outside the repo — cost or benefit)',
    checks: `Lenses 1-6 review the code. You review what this change PROPAGATES beyond the repo. Blast radius has a SIGN, and the amplitude multiplies whichever sign it has: a bug in a widely-used library is catastrophic for the same reason an improvement in it is enormously valuable. Run BOTH directions.

=== A. POSITIVE BLAST RADIUS — harm that propagates (the footprint) ===
Everything this change writes, spawns, binds, or kills that OUTLIVES THE PROCESS and is shared with software we do not own. That state has no test suite, no code review and no rollback. It is where a tool stops being wrong in its own repo and starts being wrong ON THE USER'S MACHINE.

MACHINE SCOPE IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY A SMELL, AND YOU ARE NOT HERE TO ELIMINATE IT. Some problems are intrinsically machine-scoped ("which version of this shared CLI does every shell on this box run?") and CANNOT be solved per-project; a tool that refuses to look outside its own directory just leaves them unsolved. Acting at machine scope is then a FEATURE, and scoping it down to look tidy is the actual bug. Do not file "this touches global state" as a finding on its own. Ask instead: IS IT DONE RIGHT? Done right =
  (1) SCOPED TO REAL HARM — act only on what is actually causing the problem, positively identified; never "everything that matches", never "everything older than me";
  (2) ASK, DON'T INFER — if the thing can be ASKED to stop, ask it; prefer a request over a signal, a version query over a byte-compare. Inferred values (a pid from a port, a version from file size) are where the bugs are;
  (3) SELF-TERMINATING — keyed on the condition that makes something harmful, so it stops firing once that condition is gone;
  (4) NEVER CLOBBERS A DELIBERATE CHOICE — a symlink, a pin, a hand-edited config;
  (5) REVERSIBLE, with an opt-out documented where the AFFECTED person will see it;
  (6) ACCOUNTABLE — the one everyone skips. An append-only receipt of every machine-scope action (timestamp, version, AND the cwd of the project that triggered it), announced on STDERR (harnesses swallow stdout). This matters most when the tool is a TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY: someone runs ANOTHER project's test script, it spawns this tool, and it touches their machine — and they have never heard of it. There must always be an answer to "what did this do to my machine, and which project caused it?" UNACCOUNTABLE global action is what you forbid; global action is not.

=== B. NEGATIVE BLAST RADIUS — benefit that propagates (leverage) ===
This is what a library is FOR: do a thing well in one place, and every consumer gets it for free on the next update. Ask whether this change CAPTURED that leverage or LEAKED it:
  - A LOCAL fix to a GENERAL problem is a leak — the next consumer re-hits it. Was the fix made at the layer where everyone benefits, or patched where it happened to bite?
  - DUPLICATION is a leak, and worse than untidy: it SEVERS THE PROPAGATION PATH. When the same logic lives in two places a fix reaches only one — and if the TESTED copy is the one that doesn't ship, improvements propagate to NOBODY. (This is the real cost DRY guards; report it here, from the propagation angle, when a change adds or leaves such a copy on a path that matters.)
  - PROPAGATION COST: a benefit consumers get by merely updating is true negative blast radius; one that forces every consumer to change code (a breaking change, a migration) is leverage with friction — ask whether it could have shipped without the friction.
  - GENERATED, not just propagated: a build/dev/review tool encounters the rest of the stack every run, and each encounter can leave it BETTER. Two moves, and their absence is a finding: (i) SURFACE AND ROUTE, don't absorb — a defect this diff WORKS AROUND in something it doesn't own (a dependency, the machine, another process) should be FILED upstream with the workaround kept only until the fix ships; a silent local workaround buries the signal and guarantees the next consumer re-hits it; (ii) FEED THE LESSON BACK — when this change was prompted by a bug some earlier review/build caught, was the CLASS of it encoded where the tool re-applies it automatically (a lens prompt, a preflight check, a KB entry)? A one-off catch helps one release; a hardened guard helps every release after. A diff that hand-patches around an upstream bug with no issue filed, or fixes a bug-class without hardening the guard that missed it, has left negative blast radius on the table — report it.
Not every change has a B-half finding; a pure internal refactor may capture leverage cleanly. But a change that fixes a bug LOCALLY that other consumers will hit, or that hand-copies a shared policy, has leaked leverage — say so.

FAST EXIT (applies to the A-half): if the diff writes nothing outside the repo, spawns nothing, binds nothing and kills nothing, say so in one line and return no A-half findings. Do not manufacture footprint findings — on a pure library change the A-half is correctly quiet. (Still run the B-half.)

Otherwise ENUMERATE the footprint (grep the diff for: homedir(), os.homedir, '~/', /usr/local, .local/bin, XDG_, process.kill, spawn, execSync, lsof, Bun.serve, listen, writeFileSync to paths outside the repo) and interrogate each:

- **Global binaries & PATH** (~/.local/bin, /usr/local/bin, shell rc files): ONE binary, EVERY project. If N versions of the tool can each install it, ask WHICH ONE WINS — "last process to boot" is a race, not a policy. Never clobber a symlink (it is a deliberate install; overwriting reverts someone's tooling under them).
- **Home-dir / XDG state** (~/.config, ~/.cache, dotdirs, registries, lockfiles): does it survive uninstall? Can a stale entry outlive its writer, and what reads it afterwards?
- **Other processes** — anything spawned, signalled or killed. KILLING IS A POLICY, NOT A FIX: state the predicate, and state how you IDENTIFY the victim.
  * The predicate: "older than me" is almost always WRONG — it never terminates, and two peers on adjacent versions kill each other forever. Key it on what makes the other process HARMFUL (e.g. below the version that fixed the harm) so it self-terminates.
  * The identification: BE ADVERSARIAL ABOUT HOW THE PID IS RESOLVED. Port-to-pid lookups are a classic trap — \`lsof -i :PORT\` matches sockets whose LOCAL **OR REMOTE** port is PORT, so it returns CONNECTED CLIENTS as well as the listener, and a long-lived client (a browser) usually sorts FIRST by pid. Killing pids[0] then SIGTERMs the user's browser while the actual target survives and the log cheerfully reports success. Require \`-sTCP:LISTEN\`, and sanity-check the process identity (\`ps -p PID -o comm=\`) before signalling. NEVER signal a pid you have not positively identified.
  * When it cannot act, it must COMPLAIN, not fail silently — an unfixed hazard the user does not know about is worse than a loud one.
- **Ports/sockets**: a well-known default port is shared state; squatting or reclaiming it affects whoever else wanted it.
- **THE TEST SUITE'S OWN FOOTPRINT — the sharpest edge on this lens.** Ask explicitly: DOES RUNNING THE TESTS DO ANY OF THE ABOVE? A SPAWNED process re-reads the real config path and the real \$HOME — an in-process \`dir\` option or DI seam does NOT contain it. Destructive startup behavior (killing, installing to ~/.local/bin) runs in EVERY test-spawned server unless a test explicitly disables it: grep for the opt-out env var and confirm the test spawns actually set it. This corrupts the developer's own environment, so it presents as "my tools got weird", never as a red test. CHECK THIS EVEN IF THE DIFF DOES NOT TOUCH TESTS.

Ask of each: WHO ELSE CAN THIS SURPRISE, AND CAN THEY UNDO IT? Prefer additive and reversible; where you cannot, be loud, and document the behavior and its opt-out somewhere the USER can see (README / --help / CHANGELOG — note that CLAUDE.md is usually NOT shipped to users).

Findings that touch the user's machine — a global binary, a kill policy, a test that writes to \$HOME — are BLOCKERS, not nits. A change that is correct in-repo and hostile on the machine has not passed review.`,

Review ONLY through the ${lens.title} lens:

Report concrete, ranked findings. Each finding needs a real failure scenario (or, for non-correctness lenses, the concrete cost/risk) and an actionable recommendation. Prefer a few high-signal findings over an exhaustive dump; if the diff is clean on this lens, return an empty findings array. Severity: blocker (must fix before release) / major / minor / nit. BLOCKER IS A STATUS, NOT A SEVERITY: it means only "the release waits for this" — a typo'd name in docs can be a blocker without being poor work. Report blockers without moral weight; do not frame them as failures of whoever wrote the code. For each blocker, ALSO state its RE-REVIEW SCOPE: which lens(es) must re-examine what after the fix — default "correctness + blast-radius over the remediation diff only"; for mechanical fixes (typo, missing entry) say "Tier 0 only" so the cheap case stays cheap. If you are not confident in a severity label — especially "this minor might really be a blocker" — set severityUncertain: true so it gets adversarially verified regardless of the label.`

Claimed failure/cost: ${f.failureScenario}
Claimed severity: ${f.severity}

Return: confirmed (real, reproducible as described), plausible (likely real but you couldn't fully confirm), or refuted (not a real issue, or already handled). Set adjustedSeverity only if the claimed severity is clearly wrong.`

Findings (JSON). Each has a \`verified\` flag: true = adversarially verified (a skeptic tried to refute it and failed); false = reported by the lens but NOT independently verified. By design we only spend verification where it changes the release decision — every blocker is verified; ${depth === 'fast' ? 'majors and below are not' : 'majors are too; minor/nit are not'}. An unverified finding is a lead, not a confirmed defect: never let one drive the verdict, and MARK IT as unverified in the report (e.g. "(unverified)") so the reader knows to sanity-check it before acting.

Produce a triaged report:
- Dedupe near-identical findings across lenses; keep the sharpest wording.
- Group by severity; within a group, correctness/security first.
- Recommendation: BLOCK if any confirmed blocker (or unresolved correctness/security) remains; GO_WITH_FOLLOWUPS if only non-blocking findings remain (list them as TODO items to file); GO if clean.
- Never silently drop a finding — deferred ones must appear as explicit follow-ups.
- **A failing test is never dismissed as "pre-existing" or "not caused by this change."** Any red/skipped test in the coverage findings must appear in the report — fixed if easy, otherwise flagged as a follow-up that is still scheduled, never waved away.
- **ROUTE BY LENS — findings do not all belong in the same place.** Put each follow-up under the right destination heading:
  - lenses correctness/efficiency/dryness/docs/coverage/dx -> fix now, or file to this repo's \`TODO.md\`.
  - lens **ecosystem** -> a **GitHub issue filed on the UPSTREAM repo** (name the tool and the missing seam), mirrored in this repo's \`UPSTREAM.md\` with the issue URL. NEVER a direct edit to another repo — agents stay in their own repo unless the human signs off. Also list any incoming open issues this release should have addressed or should now close.
  - lens **practices** -> a change to the shared \`tosijs-coding-practices\` repo (name the doc), and/or this repo's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md.
- **ecosystem and practices findings rarely BLOCK** — they compound. Do not let them drag the verdict to BLOCK unless something is actively broken; but never drop them either.
- **CYCLE DETECTOR (deterministic trigger).** Check \`reviews/\` in the repo: if any blocker in THIS run sits in code that was itself the remediation of a blocker from a prior report, or the same lens has blocked twice in this release cycle, add a PROCESS finding answering two questions: (1) why didn't the earlier review frame the CLASS instead of the instance ("when N findings share one precondition, the finding IS the precondition")? (2) why didn't the fix close the class — was its test one that could not fail? Name the re-framing that ends the series. (practices/review.md "Lenses are cascades".)

reportMarkdown must be a complete, ready-to-read report: a one-line verdict, a per-lens summary, the blockers, then follow-ups as checkbox TODO lines **grouped by destination** (\`TODO.md\` / \`UPSTREAM.md\` + upstream repo / shared practices), then any completeness gaps.`,

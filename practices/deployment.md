# Deployment

Pick a host by project shape. Four targets recur across the ecosystem:

- **GitHub Pages** — libraries and doc sites (the default).
- **Firebase** — full-stack apps needing auth/DB/functions.
- **Cloudflare Pages / R2 / Workers** — static asset CDNs and edge compute.
- **Tauri DMG** — desktop apps; "deploy" means code-sign + notarize, not a web host.

There is **no CI in this ecosystem** — every deploy is a hand-run local command. GitHub
Pages auto-redeploys from `main`'s `/docs` on push; everything else (Firebase deploy,
`wrangler`, `npm publish`, DMG notarize) you run yourself. See [releasing](./releasing.md)
for the version-stamp + npm-publish flow. — seen in: tosijs, tosijs-ui, tosijs-3d, tosijs-product, kith-email, loewald-dot-com

## GitHub Pages

The default for OSS libraries and doc-sites. The tosijs-ui `buildSite` prerenders one
SEO `index.html` per doc, emits sitemap/robots/`llms.txt`, and can build an ePub.
— seen in: tosijs, tosijs-ui, tosijs-3d, tosijs-product, react-tosijs, editor2

- **Serve from `main` branch `/docs`, NOT root.** `buildSite` emits root-absolute asset
  paths and writes `CNAME` + `.nojekyll` into `docs/`; serving from `/` 404s *every*
  asset. Custom domains come from the `CNAME` file in `docs/` (tosijs.net, 3d/product/react.tosijs.net).
  — seen in: tosijs-3d
- **`docs/` is generated output — never hand-edit it or put source `.md` there.**
  `buildSite` runs `rm -rf docs/` first, so anything you author in `docs/` is silently
  deleted with no error. Put source doc pages in `src/docs/*.md` and per-component docs in
  inline `/*# ... */` comments. — seen in: tosijs-product, tosijs-3d, tosijs-ui, react-tosijs, editor2
- **Verify no `docPaths` entry overlaps `outputDir` (`docs/`) before building.** `buildSite`
  deletes `outputDir` first but does NOT validate overlap — an overlapping source path is
  destroyed and the build "succeeds" producing an empty site. — seen in: tosijs-product
- **SPA-fallback trap:** if a built asset (e.g. `iife.js`) is missing, the page 404s into
  the SPA fallback and "loads as HTML." A dev-server rebuild `rm -rf docs`s and can wipe a
  separately-built bundle — rebuild the bundle, don't just restart the watch. — seen in: tosijs

**Contradiction — do you commit `docs/`?** Most projects **commit** `docs/` (and `dist/`):
it's the Pages web root served from `main`, so a push auto-redeploys, and `dist/` is the
published package. Expect large regenerated diffs; commit them, don't revert. — seen in:
tosijs, tosijs-ui, tosijs-3d, tosijs-product. **But editor2 gitignores `docs/` + `dist/`**,
so its Pages publish is a separate manual `gh-pages` step and a commit to `main` does NOT
update the site. **Rule of thumb:** check `.gitignore` before assuming a push redeploys —
commit `docs/` unless the repo deliberately ignores build output. — seen in: editor2

## Firebase

For full-stack apps needing auth, Firestore/RTDB, hosting, and Cloud Functions (positioned
as "PHP/LAMP simplicity"). Build the client to a gitignored hosting root (`.demo/`) and ship
it — but **split hosting-only from full deploys**: use `bun run deploy:hosting`
(`firebase deploy --only hosting`) for a site refresh, and reserve `bun run deploy` for when
Cloud Functions actually changed (it additionally runs `functions:deploy`, so a bare deploy
needlessly redeploys functions on every site refresh). The `functions/` subdir uses
**npm + Node**, deliberately separate from the bun-based root — run `cd functions && npm
install`. — seen in: tjs-lang, loewald-dot-com

- **Route ALL Firestore access through Cloud Functions endpoints; keep `firestore.rules`
  deny-all.** Security is enforced server-side by the access-control layer, not by rules; a
  collection with no config is deny-by-default. Bypassing the endpoints with the client SDK
  defeats field-level access control. — seen in: loewald-dot-com
- **Make access-denial opaque:** non-privileged callers get **404, not 403**, for protected
  collections — a raw 403 leaks that the collection exists. — seen in: loewald-dot-com
- Keep secrets out of the repo; use Firebase config / environment, not committed keys.
- Emulators run **compiled** code from `functions/lib/` — rebuild + restart after every
  functions change or you test stale code. — seen in: loewald-dot-com

## Cloudflare Pages / R2 / Workers

Pages for static/JAMstack, **R2** for object storage / asset CDN (free egress beats
Firebase for large binaries), **Workers** for edge compute. `cdn.tosijs.net` is the shared
asset CDN — heavy 3D/media binaries live there, and consuming repos reference them by URL
rather than duplicating. — seen in: static-assets, tosijs-3d

- **Use `bunx wrangler` / `bunx firebase-tools`, not installed deps.** The CLIs are only
  needed at deploy time (and must be logged in: `wrangler login`); keeping them out of
  `package.json` keeps the repo dependency-free. — seen in: static-assets
- **Generate host config from one source of truth.** Emit both Cloudflare `public/_headers`
  and `firebase.json` from the same metadata rules; never hand-edit the generated files (a
  rebuild clobbers them). This makes switching host a deploy/DNS choice, not a rebuild —
  the deployable stays byte-identical. — seen in: static-assets
- **Set CORS + long immutable cache on CDN responses:** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
  plus `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, immutable`. Consumers fetch cross-origin, and
  content-addressed assets are safe to cache forever. — seen in: static-assets, tjs-lang
- **Anti-harvest a public CDN:** 404 directory listings, set `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` on
  every response, ship `robots.txt` `Disallow: /`, and never publish a full namespace
  manifest — keep it usable by apps that know paths, not browsable as a bundle. — seen in: static-assets
- **Cloudflare Pages caps at <20k files** — trim the served set (via metadata excludes) to
  stay under it or deploys break. — seen in: static-assets
- Invoke the Cloudflare Claude Code skills (Workers, Pages, R2, D1, Durable Objects,
  `wrangler`) before running `wrangler` or writing Worker code, rather than working from memory.

## Tauri desktop apps

kith-email and lukko ship signed/notarized macOS DMGs — no web host at all. "Deployment"
means code-sign + notarize.

- **Notarize the DMG wrapper, not just the app.** Tauri notarizes/staples the `.app` but
  NOT the `.dmg` — submit the DMG to `notarytool` and `stapler staple` it separately, then
  verify with `spctl -a -t open --context context:primary-signature <dmg>` expecting
  "Notarized Developer ID". An un-stapled DMG is Gatekeeper-rejected as "Unnotarized" even
  when the inner app is fine. — seen in: kith-email
- **Find Cargo artifacts under the workspace-root `target/`** (`target/release/bundle/dmg/`),
  NOT `src-tauri/target/` — a multi-member workspace redirects all output to the root. — seen in: kith-email
- **Ship a self-contained backend:** `bun build --compile serve.ts` into
  `src-tauri/binaries/<name>-<arch>-apple-darwin`; the `aarch64`/`x86_64-apple-darwin` triple
  suffix is required by Tauri's sidecar resolver. `build.ts` auto-syncs `package.json`
  version into `tauri.conf.json` on every build. — seen in: lukko

## General

- Deployment is outward-facing: confirm before a first deploy to a new target, and treat
  pushing content to a host as publishing (it may be cached/indexed even if later removed).
- Prefer reproducible builds: the same `bun run build` that runs in review produces the
  artifact you ship.

## Project-specific practices

**haltija**
- Isolate concurrent server instances by **process/port, not in-app session routing** — one
  server per project via `--port`/`--name` (registered in `~/.haltija/servers/<name>.json`).
  "Process boundary is the isolation primitive" (a per-request session-token scheme was
  deleted after repeated regressions). For CI browser E2E use `haltija --headless`/`--ci`
  driving JSON fixtures via `POST /test/run`, not `bun test`.
